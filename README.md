# Design of Chaotic Pendulum with a Variable Interaction Potential
This repository includes the documentation for designing a chaotic pendulum with a variable interaction potential.
The idea for the experimental setup was taken from [this paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.4812721). 
Reproduction of the setup was not straight forward since enough detail have not been provided in that paper.
Therefore, we re-designed the setup based on the original design. 
All CAD files including the assembly are available in [GrabCad repository](https://grabcad.com/library/design-of-chaotic-pendulum-with-a-variable-interaction-potential-1)
In this repository, we provide a write-up that explains the components and how to run the setup properly.
In addition, the codes required to run the experiment and to post-process the experimental data is available in this repository.
